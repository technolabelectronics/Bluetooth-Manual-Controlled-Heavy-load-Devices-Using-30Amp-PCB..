# Introduction.

In this article, I am going to make a home-automation in which we control heavy load appliances like AC, Geyser, washing machines from the android smartphone.
And for making of this home automation system we don't required any iot platform like blynk, esp-rain-maker.

Here We  uses the inbuilt Bluetooth feature of esp32. So in this way we can easily connect the smartphones application to the ESP32 via Bluetooth, and we can easily control the appliances from the app.

This Home-automation system is very useful for those people who lived in rural areas, or don't have internet connection .

And we all know very well, automating the devices using iot platforms like blynk and esp-rainmaker, we do require internet connection.

So, people who live in those areas, there they don't have internet access, for those people, this home-automation is very useful.

They can automate their appliances from this PCB.
The only drawback of this home-automation is that ....we can only control the appliances from the local area network.

In this home-automation system we can easily  control the appliances from the android smartphone application.

And apart from this app we can also control it through the manual switch buttons.
Like we usually do.

So here we can easily control the appliances from the smartphone application as well from the manual switch buttons.

Apart from this PCB I have other home-automation PCBs.

These pcbs are fully tested and works very well These PCBs are best for any kind of  home-automation.
